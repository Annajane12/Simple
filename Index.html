                    <br><b>Intro</b><br>
                    Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately<br>
                    Focused on the things that didn't make no sense<br>
                    Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy<br>
                    Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways<br>
                    <br>Didn't really care about how everyone felt<br>
                    Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays<br>
                    Oh, but what is lost ain't gone<br>
                    No, you can't just let go<br>
                    'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong<br>
                    Embrace your flaws<br>
                    <br><b>Chorus</b><br>
                    I'm not gonna fight back what I've become<br>
                    Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from<br>
                    But I wouldn't change if I could restart<br>
                    I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars<br>
                    I've been going way too hard on myself<br>
                    Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell<br>
                    But I wouldn't change if I could restart<br>
                    I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars<br>
                    <br><b>Verse</b><br>
                    I went down a road that only got me nowhere<br>
                    I've seen every corner, every inch of this place<br>
                    Being all alone it really got me thinking<br>
                    Maybe overthinking<br>
                    That what is lost ain't gone<br>
                    No, you can't just let go<br>
                    'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong<br>
                    Embrace your flaws<br>
                    <br><b>Chorus</b><br>
                    I'm not gonna fight back what I've become<br>
                    Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from<br>
                    But I wouldn't change if I could restart<br>
